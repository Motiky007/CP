            Dear Bro,
            <br>
            I’ve been wondering how your holiday plans are coming along. Are you still planning on having a party this holiday season? I honestly don’t know how you keep up with everything. You must already be exhausted, and it’s only the 12th. I hope you are resting enough and taking some time for yourself. How are Henri and the kids? I do hope everyone is well and happy.
We are well, and working on finishing our semester to enjoy a bit of time off. Vasu and I both have exam papers still to grade and final grades to enter. Soon it will be the holiday, though, and we are looking forward to lounging at the house and doing some reading for enjoyment!
            <br>
            Seeing the holiday decorations recently reminded me of you and the holiday parties your mom and dad had every year when we were young. I remember so well the beautiful tree and the holly decorating the banister of your stairway.
Remember how we would sneak down to the kitchen for cookies and hot cocoa? We were so certain your parents didn’t notice, but looking back, it’s interesting how the cocoa and cookies were always on the counter and ready for us! The innocence of childhood is a wonderful thing. I know your kids are busy making lifelong memories just like we were.
I sent some recipes I cut out of one of my magazines and a tin of cookies I made with the holiday cookie recipe. They are just like the ones we snuck into the kitchen for when we were kids.
            <br>
            Love,
            <br>
